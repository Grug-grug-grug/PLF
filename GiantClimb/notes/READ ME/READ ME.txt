Hi, thanks for purchasing my CHARACTER CONTROLLER for platformers. 

Find a better version of the guide on itch.io or docs.google.com/document/d/16BuSNARsOfhfUjQFIxZSUdSWvRAXziRjrmMzrxflklo/edit?usp=sharing

Setup:
1. In the create event of your player character, 
   run 'movement_initiate();' 
   You can change all of the variables at any time, 
   in this example the default variables are changed. 
   (You can find a list of all the variables below)

2. In the step event of your player, 
   run 'movement_update();' 
   (You could also update the variables here, 
   for example, 
   if you had a booster you could change the speed when colliding with the booster)

3. Create an object named 'obj_collider' 
   and add all the objects that you want to be collidable as its children

If you find a bug, or have a suggestion please contact me on itch.io.
Good luck with the rest of your game!

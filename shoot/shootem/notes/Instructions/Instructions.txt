Hello and Welcome!

This is a very fast and simple to setup pause system to your games.

The first thing to do is add the object "oPauseButtom" to the room. The layer for this buttom is 
not really relevant. And position it using the white rectangle of the viewport in the room editor.
If you want to have a visible pause buttom in your game, just add some sprite to this object (oPauseButtom).
If this object don't have a sprite, the only way to pause is with the keyboard, that is configurable 
changing the "Key Press" event. Just change it to the key that you want. 

The second thing to do is to enable viewports and make it visible. I configured the pause system to use 
viewport 0, if you want to use any other, just change it in the create and draw events of the oPauseButtom.

The third thing to do is to add the Label and Buttons of the paused menu. I highly recomend that the layer
of these buttons and label is above the layer of the oPauseButtom.
Just position the label and buttoms using the white rectangle of the viewport in the room editor. These 
positions will be the positions that the player will see them in the game. Do not worry, they will keep
the position relative to the viewport.

If you want to add new labels or buttoms for the pause menu, just duplicate the oPauseExitButtom and
change the code used in the left pressed event.

Now you have a fully functional pause menu for your games. Fast and easy.

Happy game making!!!
